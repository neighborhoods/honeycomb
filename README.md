# comb #
`comb` serves as an abstraction around connections to a Hadoop/Hive-based
data lake and other databases, built with extensibility to other services in
mind. It handles connections, type conversions, a degree of query generation,
and more for users, in order to greatly reduce the degree of technical
expertise and Python knowledge required to interact with the NHDS data lake
and other data repositories. In doing this, we aim to increase data
availability throughout the organization, and facilitate any individual
member feeling empowered to interact with data.
